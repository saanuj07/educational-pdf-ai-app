## 🚀 How to Upload Your Educational PDF AI App to GitHub

### Step 1: Install Git (Required)

**Download Git for Windows:**
1. Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Download and install Git for Windows
3. During installation, choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
4. Restart PowerShell/Command Prompt after installation

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and sign in to your account
2. **Click the "+" icon** in the top right corner
3. **Select "New repository"**
4. **Fill in repository details:**
   - Repository name: `educational-pdf-ai-app`
   - Description: `🚀 Educational PDF AI App - Transform PDFs into interactive learning content using IBM Watson AI`
   - Set to **Public** (recommended for portfolio) or **Private**
   - ✅ **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
   - ✅ **DO NOT** add .gitignore (we already have one)
   - ✅ **DO NOT** choose a license (we already have one)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 3: Initialize Git Repository

Open PowerShell and run these commands:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd "D:\Summer Ceritficate\my-educational-app"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create initial commit

# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/educational-pdf-ai-app.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**⚠️ Important:** Replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

### Step 4: Verify Upload

1. **Go to your GitHub repository** page
2. **Check that all files are uploaded:**
   - README.md with full documentation
   - .gitignore (protecting sensitive files)
   - LICENSE file
   - All source code files
   - GitHub Actions workflow
   - Environment example files

3. **Verify .gitignore is working:**
   - Your `.env` files should NOT be visible (they contain API keys)
   - `node_modules/` should NOT be uploaded
   - `uploads/` directory should NOT be uploaded

### Step 5: Add Repository Topics (Optional)

On your GitHub repository page:
1. Click the ⚙️ **Settings** gear icon next to "About"
2. Add these topics: `education`, `ai`, `watson`, `react`, `nodejs`, `pdf`, `machine-learning`, `text-to-speech`, `natural-language-processing`
3. Add description: `🚀 Educational PDF AI App - Transform PDFs into interactive learning content using IBM Watson AI`
4. Add website URL if you deploy it

### Step 6: Create Development Branch (Recommended)

```powershell
# Create and switch to development branch
git checkout -b develop

# Push development branch
git push -u origin develop

# Switch back to main
git checkout main
```

### Step 7: Set Up Branch Protection (Optional)

On GitHub:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Branches**
2. **Add rule** for `main` branch
3. Enable:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass
   - ✅ Restrict pushes to matching branches
