# 🔒 Security Advisory

## Known Development Dependency Vulnerabilities

This repository shows security warnings from GitHub's automated scanning. Here's what you need to know:

### ✅ **These Are Safe to Ignore Because:**

1. **Development Only**: These vulnerabilities are in build tools (webpack-dev-server, postcss, nth-check)
2. **Not in Production**: They only run on developer machines, not your deployed app
3. **No User Impact**: End users never interact with these vulnerable components
4. **Common Issue**: Most React apps have these same warnings

### 🛡️ **What We've Done for Security:**

- ✅ **API Keys Protected**: All sensitive data is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ **Input Validation**: File uploads are properly validated
- ✅ **Authentication**: Watson services use secure IAM auth
- ✅ **No Data Exposure**: User files stay local, not uploaded to external services

### 🔧 **For Worried Users:**

If you want to minimize warnings (though it's not necessary):

1. **Use newer React version**: Create React App 5+ has fewer warnings
2. **Or use Vite**: Modern build tool with fewer dependency vulnerabilities
3. **Or ignore dev dependencies**: Focus only on production security

### 📊 **Risk Assessment:**

| Component | Risk Level | Reason |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Production App | 🟢 Low | No vulnerabilities in production code |
| Development Tools | 🟡 Low-Medium | Only affects developer machines |
| User Data | 🟢 Low | Files processed locally, not sent to external services |

**Bottom Line**: Your app is secure for end users. The warnings are about developer tools, not your actual application.
