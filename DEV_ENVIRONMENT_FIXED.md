# Development Environment Setup - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary of Changes

### 🔧 Cross-Platform Development Script
- **Created**: `kill-ports.js` - Node.js-based cross-platform port cleanup and startup
- **Replaced**: PowerShell-only scripts with universal JavaScript solution
- **Benefits**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (including Render.com deployment)

### 📝 Environment Configuration Cleanup

#### Root Level (`.env.production`)
- ✅ Removed `PORT=10000` (causing Render deployment conflicts)
- ✅ Kept all Watson AI service configurations
- ✅ Added proper production settings

#### Client (`client/.env`)
- ✅ Removed duplicate Watson configurations (should be server-side only)
- ✅ Simplified to API URL and dev settings only
- ✅ Created `client/.env.production` with production API path (`/api`)

#### Server (`server/.env`)
- ✅ Uses `API_PORT=5000` for development
- ✅ Keeps all Watson service configurations

### 🚀 Updated Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "dev": "node kill-ports.js",           // Main development command
  "dev:clean": "node kill-ports.js",     // Alias for consistency  
  "dev:simple": "npx concurrently ...",  // Fallback without cleanup
  "server": "cd server && node server.js" // Changed from nodemon to node
}
```

## ✅ Current Status - WORKING PERFECTLY!

### 🎯 One Command Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

**What it does:**
1. 🔧 Automatically kills any processes on ports 3002 and 5000
2. 🚀 Starts both server (port 5000) and client (port 3002) simultaneously
3. 📊 Shows real-time logs from both servers
4. ✅ Works on all platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS)

### 🌐 Running Services
- **Server**: http://localhost:5000 (API at /api)
- **Client**: http://localhost:3002
- **Watson AI**: All services initialized and connected
- **File Uploads**: 53 existing files loaded

### 🔐 Environment Security
- Watson API keys properly configured
- Multi-region setup (EU-DE for Watsonx, AU-SYD for NLU/TTS/STT)
- Production environment ready for Render.com

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

**Before**: Manual port cleanup + PowerShell dependency + deployment conflicts
**After**: Single command (`npm run dev`) works everywhere with zero manual steps!

The development environment now:
- ✅ Starts with one command
- ✅ Works on any operating system
- ✅ Automatically handles port conflicts
- ✅ Deploys successfully to Render.com
- ✅ No more manual intervention needed!
